# Spliced-RNA-extraction-structure
RNA sequence extraction + structure prediction
This github repo will provide an easy way to get the spliced mRNA fasta sequence from the HG38 reference genome with only a .txt file of gene names as input.
The algorithm can also predict the 2D structure using ViennaRNA algorithm RNAfold
